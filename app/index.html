											What is the Internet of Things?
										</h2>
										<p>
											The internet is a powerful tool for fast, long distance communication. With the ever
											increasing power of embedded electronics, the internet is no longer just being used
											by laptops and desktop computers. Increasingly, more and more electronic devices are
											being equipped with the ability to send information over the internet.
											<br> <br>
											This phenomenon has been dubbed "The Internet of Things". It is a major force within
											our society now that brings both

										<h2>
											What is Aether?
										</h2>
										<p>
											Aether is an Internet of Things(IOT) web platform that enables virtual
											collaboration through data sharing.
											<br>
											It allows users to connect by sending data between artworks
											and objects in real time.
											<br>
											We want to create opportunities for virtual and cross-disciplinary collaboration.
											We want to investigate the physicality of the Internet of Things, and we want to
											question the role of technology and information transfer in contemporary art practice.
										</p>

										<h2>
											How does it work?
										</h2>
										<p>
											We are developing Aether to be flexible and user-friendly.
											Artworks and objects with an internet connection can be
											connected to the platform to send or receive data.
											Each artwork connected to Aether will need a microcontroller with an internet connection.
											Adding a few lines of code from our library will allow the
											microcontroller to connect to our server.
											From the Aether platform you will be able to see a list of
											connected artworks and choose which artwork youâ€™d like to connect to.
											Connected artworks are separated into senders and receivers.
											Senders gather data and send it to the platform.
											Receivers access the data from a Sender. Simple.
											Each member will be free to interpret the data in
											whatever way they want and their artwork can take any form.
											We will also be running an entry-level workshop programme to support the Aether platform.
